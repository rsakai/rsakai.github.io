description: Data Sculptures to represent SNP array data of chickens

---
In collaboration with a Belgian artist, [Koen Vanmechelen](http://www.ccrp.be), we generated data sculptures based on the SNP array data of chickens from the Cosmopolitan Research Project. 

Koen Vanmechelen started the Cosmopolitan Chicken Project to reflect on the issues of (biological, cultural, behavioural, …) diversity in the human population in 90s. Vanmechelen crosses pure-bred chicken lines to create the true “cosmopolitan chicken”. At present, 16 different breeds have been combined in a single hybrid.

Each ring represents a chromosome, thus varying lengthes. Spikes pointing inwards represents homozygous polymorphisms and those pointing outwards represents heterozygous polymorphisms. As a result, inbred chickens have more peaks pointing inwards while crossbred chickens have more peaks pointing outwards.

These sculptures were 3D printed using the Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). Vanmechelen incorporated these data-driven sculptures into his exhibitions at Biennial of Venice and BOZAR Electronic Arts Festival in 2013.
