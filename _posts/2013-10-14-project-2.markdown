description: Visualization of multiple sequence alignments sets.

---
The sequence logo has been the long-standing convention for visualization of multiple sequence alignments of nucleotides or amino acids for the past few decades. Although it effectively communicates the amount of information / conservation present at every position, this visual encoding falls short when the analysis task is to compare between two or more sets of aligned sequences. 

We participated in the BioVis 2013 redesign contest, and our design received an honorable mention.

The paper on Sequence Diversity Diagram is available from [here](http://bmcproc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1753-6561-8-S2-S9).

This video demonstrates a visual analytics tool (called Seagull) to include circular representation the mutual information between positions and the Jmol (Java molecular viewer) to explore the highly conserved positions in 3D structures.


The below are some data sketches we made during the design process.
