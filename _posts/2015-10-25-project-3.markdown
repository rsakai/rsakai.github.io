The [VAST Challenge 2015](http://vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2015) presented two related mini-challenges and an overall Grand Challenge, and we prepared submissions for each category, and our Mini-Challenge 1 received an award, **Good Combination of Analysis and Visualization to Solve the Challenge**.

The majority of analysis was performed in R, and all of the source code, our submissions, as well as reviewers' comments are available from [this git repository](https://bitbucket.org/vda-lab/vast_2015). 

The following videos shows our analysis approaches and some of findings.
